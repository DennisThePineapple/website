            <p>Howdy, y'all! We're happy to announce our biggest event of the year, the UQCS Hackathon, will be on
                October 16th to 18th.</p>

            <p>If you aren't familiar with how the UQCS Hackathon works, it's pretty simple:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Form your team
                <li>Build something cool</li>
                <li>Eat Free Food</li>
                <li>Present what you have made</li>
                <li>Win prizes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In the past people have built websites, desktop apps, games, hardware, and even robots and if you've
                never been to a Hackathon before, don't worry as we'll be running a talk beforehand walking through what
                to do at your first Hackathon.
            </p>
            <p>We'll have $2500 in prizes up for grabs across nine categories:</p>

            <h5>$1000 - Best Overall Project</h5>

            <p>The creators of the best project (as determined by our celebrity judges) will take home a whopping $1000
                dollars (not to mention bragging rights)!
            </p>
            <h5>$500 - Best Overall Runner Up Project</h5>

            <p>The second placed team (as determined by our celebrity judges) will take home $500.
            </p>
            <h5>200 - Best Newcomer Project</h5>

            <p>The best team consisting entirely of students in their first or second semester of university (in any
                discipline) will find themselves the proud owners of $200 to distribute between from themselves.
            </p>
            <h5>$200 - People's Choice</h5>

            <p>After presentations have concluded on the Sunday night, you'll have the chance to vote for your favourite
                project, the project with the most votes will take home 200 big ones.
            </p>
            <h5>$200 - Best Philanthropic Project</h5>

            <p>The best project (as determined by our celebrity judges) aimed at helping a philanthropic organisation or
                addressing a social justice problem will earn a nice $200 reward (who said being nice didn't pay off?).
            </p>
            <h5>$100 - Best Designed Project</h5>

            <p>The creator(s) of the project demonstrating the coolest visual design will take home their choice of $100
                to spend on turtlenecks or a pirated PDF copy of Banksy's art book Wall and Piece.
            </p>
            <h5>$100 - Most Masochistic Project</h5>

            <p>The project that caused the most pain for its creators will earn them $100. It's not enough to make up
                for a weekend of self-inflicted misery, but it helps.
            </p>
            <h5>$100 - Best Hardware Project</h5>

            <p>Hardware projects are hard, it's in the name. Here's $100 for having the best one.
            </p>
            <h5>$100 - Best Interdisciplinary Project</h5>

            <p>UQCS likes to mix things up. The best project demonstrating skills or solving problems from other
                disciplines (science, math, and dare we say it... humanities) will be eligible for $100 cash.
            </p>
